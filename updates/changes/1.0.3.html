    <h1>Spectacle 1.0.3</h1>
    <p>This version of Spectacle provides the following improvements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Addresses an issue where windows would "slide" into incorrect positions</li>
      <li>Resolves issues when windows with restricted dimensions would be positioned off the screen</li>
      <li>Restores the proper behavior of moving quantized windows (e.g. Terminal or iTerm 2) into thirds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks to everyone who has helped make Spectacle better by reporting issues and opening pull requests! Spectacle has been long overdue for 1.0 release and it would not have been possible without the help from so many great folks.</p>
    <p><b>Important Note</b>: Spectacle now requires OS X 10.9 or better. Please review the <a href="https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle#system-requirements">README</a> for additional information.</p>
