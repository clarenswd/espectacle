    <h1>Spectacle 0.6.10</h1>
    <p>This version of Spectacle provides the following improvements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixes an issue where moving a window to a different display would always maximize it</li>
      <li>Displays an error when trying to set a keyboard shortcut that Spectacle is already using</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that Spectacle is no longer released on the App Store changes were made in this release to support future updates outside the App Store.</p>
