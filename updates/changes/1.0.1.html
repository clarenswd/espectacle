    <h1>Spectacle 1.0.1</h1>
    <p>This version of Spectacle provides the following improvements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports shortcuts saved with older versions of Spectacle</li>
      <li>Fixes an issue where Spectacle would not work with certain windows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks to everyone who has helped make Spectacle better by reporting issues and opening pull requests! Spectacle has been long overdue for 1.0 release and it would not have been possible without the help from so many great folks.</p>
    <p><b>Important Note</b>: Spectacle now requires OS X 10.9 or better. Please review the <a href="https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle#system-requirements">README</a> for additional information.</p>
